## Synopsis

The public repository for storing and looking up varbits and varps based on the game data from RuneScape. 

## Motivation

With a lot of data being available through the varbits and varps in RuneMate/RuneScape, there wasn't yet a place to index all these varbits and varps. 

To avoid having to re-produce certain environments to test out which varbit or varp goes with a situation, a place like this was considered the best solution by a couple of developers.

The collection is open-source and can be used by everyone. However, data may be incorrect, because of the open-source nature of this index. Threat with caution! If you happen to find an issue with one of the indexed items, please open an issue.
## Contributors

- Auxi
